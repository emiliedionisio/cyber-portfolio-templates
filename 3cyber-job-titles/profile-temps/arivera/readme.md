## 👋 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Alison Rivera** — a dedicated **Incident Responder** passionate about investigating, containing, and remediating security incidents to protect organizational assets and data.  

I specialize in **digital forensics**, **threat detection**, and **incident triage**, combining strong analytical skills with hands-on technical experience in SIEM tools, endpoint forensics, and malware investigation. I thrive on transforming chaos into clarity — identifying root causes, mitigating threats, and improving response playbooks for future resilience.  

With a background in **IT consulting and cybersecurity support**, I’ve built and managed secure environments across cloud and on-prem infrastructures. My experience includes triaging SOC alerts, conducting forensic imaging, analyzing malicious files, and collaborating with Blue Team and Threat Intel units during major incident investigations.  

What drives me most is the challenge — uncovering the “how” and “why” behind an incident, and using that knowledge to strengthen defenses and educate others.
