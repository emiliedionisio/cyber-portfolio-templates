## 🎯 Featured Projects  

### 1. [**SOC Threat Detection Lab**](siem-threat-detection.md)
**Skills:** SIEM Configuration, Log Analysis, Threat Detection, Data Visualization  

Deployed a **Splunk-based SIEM environment** to collect, normalize, and analyze logs from multiple network endpoints.  
Created **custom correlation searches** to detect brute-force, beaconing, and lateral movement patterns.  

**Key Achievements:**  
- Correlated 500K+ security events in real time  
- Built 20+ detection rules mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques  
- Reduced MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) by 60%  
- Developed executive dashboards for security KPIs  

**Tools:** Splunk, Sysmon, Zeek, Windows Event Logs, Python SDK

**Skills:** Incident Response, Digital Forensics, Malware Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK  

Simulated a ransomware attack to practice end-to-end incident handling — from detection to recovery.  
Performed forensic analysis to determine root cause and mapped adversary behavior to ATT&CK TTPs.  

**Highlights:**  
- Documented 50+ IOCs and event timelines  
- Forensic analysis using Autopsy and Volatility  
- Root cause: phishing email leading to credential theft  
- Developed IR playbook and post-incident recommendations  

**Tools:** Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark, YARA, KAPE
