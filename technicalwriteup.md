## Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) - Penetration Test

**Author:** Alex Rivera  
**Date:** October 28, 2024  
**Classification:** Educational/Training Exercise  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive security assessment conducted on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) version 2.0, a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for security training purposes. The assessment was performed in a controlled laboratory environment to identify common web application vulnerabilities and demonstrate exploitation techniques.

The penetration test revealed **15 critical and high-severity vulnerabilities** across multiple categories of the OWASP Top 10, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, and insecure authentication mechanisms. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and underlying systems. Successful exploitation demonstrated the ability to extract sensitive database information, execute arbitrary commands on the server, and bypass authentication controls.

This assessment serves as a practical demonstration of common web application security flaws and provides detailed remediation guidance for each identified vulnerability. All testing was conducted ethically within an isolated lab environment with proper authorization. The findings highlight the critical importance of secure coding practices, input validation, and defense-in-depth security controls in web application development.

## 3. Methodology & Tools

### 3.1 Testing Methodology

The assessment followed a structured penetration testing methodology based on OWASP Testing Guide v4 and PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**
- Application mapping and enumeration
- Technology stack identification
- Entry point discovery

**Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**
- Automated scanning for common vulnerabilities
- Manual code review and logic flaw identification
- Input validation testing

**Phase 3: Exploitation**
- Proof-of-concept development for identified vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Data extraction and impact demonstration

**Phase 4: Post-Exploitation**
- Persistence mechanism analysis
- Lateral movement possibilities
- Data exfiltration scenarios

**Phase 5: Reporting**
- Documentation of findings with evidence
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Remediation guidance

## 4. Detailed Findings

### Finding #1: SQL Injection in User ID Parameter

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS v3.1 Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**CWE:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command)

#### Description
The User ID input field in the SQL Injection module is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries and extract sensitive information.

#### Affected Component
- **Module:** SQL Injection
- **Parameter:** `id`
- **URL:** `http://192.168.1.100/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/`
- **Method:** GET

#### Proof of Concept

**Step 1: Basic SQL Injection Test**
